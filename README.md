# Filmawit Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch. Built using HTML and CSS, it highlights my experience, projects, and contact details in a simple, clean, and easy-to-navigate way.

## What This Project Is About

I created this website to share my professional journey and skills as a Project Manager and Educator. It’s designed to give visitors a quick overview of my background, some of the projects I've worked on, and ways to connect with me.

## Why It’s Useful

Whether you’re a potential employer, collaborator, or just curious, this portfolio provides a straightforward way to learn about my work and get in touch. The site is responsive and accessible, so it works well on all devices and for a wide range of users.

## How It Works

The website has three main sections:

- **Home:** An introduction about me and what I do.
- **Projects:** Highlights of my professional projects and experience.
- **Contact:** A simple form and links to reach out to me.

I built the navigation menu to be consistent across all pages, making it easy to explore.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for page structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- No external frameworks yet, but I’m open to adding Bootstrap or others later

## Deployment

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be viewed live here:

## Attribution

- All HTML and CSS code is written by me.
- No external code or libraries are included at this stage.
- Should I add any third-party code or assets in the future, I will clearly note and attribute them here.

## What’s Next?

- Make the site fully responsive for mobile devices with media queries.
- Add form validation and interactive elements with JavaScript.
- Include screenshots and documentation for testing.
- Possibly incorporate a CSS framework like Bootstrap for faster styling.
